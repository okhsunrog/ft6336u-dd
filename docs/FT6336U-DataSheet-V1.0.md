# 2 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Architectural Overview

Figure 2-1 shows the overall architecture for the FT6336U.

![img-0.jpeg](FT6336U-DataSheet-V1.0_images/img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2-1 FT6336U System Architecture Diagram

The FT6336U is comprised of five main functional parts listed below,

- Touch Panel Interface Circuits

The main function for the AFE and AFE controller is to interface with the touch panel. It scans the panel by sending AC signals to the panel and processes the received signals from the panel. So it supports both driver and Sensor functions. Key parameters to configure this circuit can be sent via serial interfaces.

- Enhanced MCU

For the Enhanced MCU, larger program and data memories are supported. Furthermore, A Flash ROM is implemented to store

programs and some key parameters.

Complex signal processing algorithms are implemented by MCU to detect the touches reliably and efficiently.

Communication protocol software is also implemented on this MCU to exchange data and control information with the host processor.

External Interface

I2C: an interface for data exchange with host
INT: an interrupt signal to inform the host processor that touch data is ready for read
RSTN: an external low signal reset the chip.

- A watch dog timer is implemented to ensure the robustness of the chip.
- A voltage regulator to generate 1.5V for digital circuits from the input VDDA supply.

# 2.2 MCU

This section describes some critical features and operations supported by the Enhanced MCU.

Figure 2-2 shows the overall structure of the MCU block. In addition to the Enhanced MCU core, we have added the following circuits,

Memory: 48KB Flash
Data Memory: 5KB SRAM
- Timer: A number of timers are available to generate different clocks
- Master Clock:18MHz from a 36MHz RC Oscillator
- Clock Manager: To control various clocks under different operation conditions of the system

Figure 2-2 MCU Block Diagram

# 2.3 Operation Modes

FT6336U operates in the following three modes:

Active Mode

In this mode, FT6336U actively scans the panel. The default scan rate is 60 frames per second. The host processor can configure FT6336U to speed up or to slow down.

Monitor Mode

In this mode, FT6336U scans the panel at a reduced speed. The default scan rate is 25 frames per second and the host processor can increase or decrease this rate. When in this mode, most algorithms are stopped. A simpler algorithm is being executed to determine if there is a touch or not. When a touch is detected, FT6336U shall enter the Active mode immediately to acquire the touch information quickly. During this mode, the serial port is closed and no data shall be transferred with the host processor

- Hibernation Mode

In this mode, the chip is set in a power down mode. It shall respond to the "RESET" or "Wakeup" signal from the host processor. The chip therefore consumes very little current, which help prolong the standby time for the portable devices.

Host Interface Figure 2-3 shows the interface between a host processor and FT6336U. This interface consists of the following three sets of signals:

- Serial Interface

- Interrupt from FT6336U to the Host
- Reset Signal from the Host to FT6336U

![img-2.jpeg](FT6336U-DataSheet-V1.0_images/img-2.jpeg)
Figure 2-3 Host Interface Diagram

The serial interface of FT6336U is I2C. The details of this interface are described in detail in Section 2.4. The interrupt signal (/INT) is used for FT6336U to inform the host that data are ready for the host to receive. The RSTN signal is used for the host to reset FT6336U. After resetting, FT6336U shall enter the Active mode.

## 2.4 Serial Interface

FT6336U supports the I2C interfaces, which can be used by a host processor or other devices.

## 2.4.1 I2C

The I2C is always configured in the Slave mode. The data transfer format is shown in Figure 2-4.

# 3.5 POWER ON/Reset/Wake Sequence

The GPIO such as INT and I2C are advised to be low before powering on. Reset should be pulled down to be low before powering on. INT signal will be sent to the host after initializing all parameters and then start to report points to the host. If Power is down, the voltage of supply must be below 0.3V and Trst is more than 5ms.
